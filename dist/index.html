                                Deciding to try therapy for the first time or returning to therapy after realizing you still need help can feel challenging. Lauren brings experience in outpatient mental health as well as ongoing training in working with people deeply and compassionately to her practice. Through determining each client’s unique treatment needs, Lauren strives to create a space where therapeutic trust can be experienced. She will listen closely to your lived experience and history to try to understand what is getting in the way of living fully and authentically.

                                Many of the people Lauren works with have had experiences in their past that continue to make things hard. Some have difficulty in relationships with peers, family members or in their professional lives. Lauren helps people identify the “root cause” of these difficulties and find ways to understand their meaning while building upon already existing strengths to live more satisfyingly in the world.
